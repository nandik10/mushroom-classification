# mushroom-classification

Classification project using Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifiers with Python

<h1>Introduction</h1>

In this project, we will examine the data and build different machine learning models that will detect if the mushroom is edible or poisonous by its specifications like cap shape, cap color, gill color, etc. using different classifiers.

<h1>Dataset</h1>

The dataset used in this project is mushrooms.csv that contains 8124 instances of mushrooms with 23 features like cap-shape, cap-surface, cap-color, bruises, odor, etc.

The python libraries and packages we’ll use in this project are namely:

    NumPy
    Pandas
    Seaborn
    Matplotlib
    Graphviz
    Scikit-learn

We’ll use the specifications like cap shape, cap color, gill color, etc. to classify the mushrooms into edible and poisonous.
